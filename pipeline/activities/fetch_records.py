"""
Insight Harbor — Fetch Records Activity
=========================================
Fetches paginated audit records from a completed query and streams
them to ADLS as JSONL.

Matches PAX's per-page streaming model:
  • One page in memory at a time (~2 MB)
  • Each page appended to ADLS append blob
  • Zero local file system usage
